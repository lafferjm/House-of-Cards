House Of Cards
--------------------

===============
= Description =
===============
House of Cards is an application written in c++ and SDL.  It is a compilation of four popular casino games; in-between, video poker,
in-between, and slots.  In the applications current state, only two of these games work.  These games are in-between and video poker.

================
= Requirements =
================
--SDL 1.2
--SDL_ttf
--SDL_image
--A c compiler to build the binary
--Make

=======================
= Building the binary =
=======================
This game was developed on Linux, because of this a Makefile has been included with the project.  To build the game on a *nix system
navigate to the games directory and run make.  Because I do not run windows, I did not build a binary for it.  Here is a link that can help
you compile the project http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/windows/index.php

====================
= Running the game =
====================
To run the game navigate to the games directory, and run the Run executable.  Rules for the two games can be found at the following sites:
--In-between: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acey_Deucey_%28card_game%29
--Video Poker: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_poker#Jacks_or_Better

Please keep in mind that this is an early version of the game, and bugs still exist.  As development continues they should all be worked out, along
with a complete overhaul of the user interface.
